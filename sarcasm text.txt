I love sarcasm. It’s like punching people in the face but with words.
wow you are so much intelligent that you cannot even write one sentence correctly
It’s okay if you don’t like me. Not everyone has good taste.
If you find me offensive. Then I suggest you quit finding me.
I clapped because it’s finished, not because I like it.
No, you don’t have to repeat yourself. I was ignoring you the first time.
